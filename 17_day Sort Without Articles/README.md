# 17 - Sort Without Articles

**Challenge:** Sort an array of band names without "The," "An," or "A" in front of the actual band name, because those are articles and they don't go into alphabetizing your actual name of the band.

**Things to Learn:** Array methods sort, map and join, Regex replace().
